# TYPO3 CMS Content Blocks GUI

> **Alpha state**: This extension may contain bugs and can potentially break
> your TYPO3 installation. **Do not install on production systems.** Use only
> in development environments.

The Content Blocks GUI provides a visual backend module for creating and editing
[Content Blocks](https://github.com/friendsoftypo3/content-blocks) definitions.
It serves as a kickstarter and YAML editor for the Content Blocks extension,
allowing integrators to build Content Elements, Page Types, Record Types, and
Basics through a drag-and-drop interface instead of writing YAML by hand.
